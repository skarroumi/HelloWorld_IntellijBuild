# HelloWorld_IntellijBuild
Hello World multi-modules using Intellij IDEA build system

To grasp the difference between vanilla build and Gradle-based builds, i created this peoject and used INTELLIJ IDEA as the build system, this latter is nothing but manual java build using GUI (basically using compiler API).
I purposefully added the build directory to the tracked files.

Tasks accomplished:
1. Create a new and a empty Java project with Intellij as build system
2. Setup of multi-modules(1 and 2)
3. Setup of dependencies between modules
4. Customization of build output names and paths
5. Generation and execution of artifacts (.JAR)
